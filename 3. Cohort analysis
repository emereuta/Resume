# Based on sample data set, it appears that customers acquired in 2015  (i.e. Cohort_2015) where the ones driving busines in subsequent year.
# Roughly 10% of revenue earned in 2016 came from customers acquired in 2016, with Cohort 16's share fading away further in upcoming year.
# I really like this analysis, because it shows you which type of customers is driving business in any given year: existing or new?
